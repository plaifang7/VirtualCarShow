# Virtual Car Show

This is my capstone project for the Web Development Immersive course at GA. I decided to call it the virtual car show because I wanted it to be an app where automobile connoisseurs can post all of their show cars and also give othe users the opportunity to see where they will be showing their cars as well. I am a huge car fan and would love to be  a web dev in the automobile industry if given the opportunity. In this project, I challenged myself with Devise Auth and Ruby on Rails w/ React. I am happy to say that I was able to create a full stack app that taught me a lot of things about myself as a developer.

* In Version 2, I would like to:
     * Pull in a 3rd Party API to inform the user of the weather for the car shows they plan to attend.
     * Use Modals as opposed to forms for all my create routes.
     * Seperate the User Login form and the Create User form.
